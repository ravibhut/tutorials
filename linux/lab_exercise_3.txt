Create a shell script which displays the tree structure of the directories and sub-directories or files in the current directory upon it's execution.

For example,

A directory contains B directory.

B directory contains C directory and f.txt file.

C directory contains d.txt and e.jpg files.

right now you're in A directory and execute the script then output will be like :

ravi.bhut@RSPL-204:~/Desktop/linux/A$ tree A
A
└── B
    ├── C
    │   ├── d.txt
    │   └── e.jpg
    └── f.txt

2 directories, 3 files
